        <p class="is-size-5">As a regular client of Ruby we wanted to let you know that she is no longer going to be
          working in the salon.
          She has been offered an opportunity to study for a degree in digital healthcare science which she decided was
          an opportunity too good to let go of.</p>
        <p>It's been a real pleasure having Ruby carry out her apprenticeship with us. She recently passed her endpoint
          with a distinction. The door is always open if she decides that hairdressing is the career for her!</p>
        <p>Ruby's last day in the salon will be <strong>Friday 18th March</strong>. If you have an appointment booked in
          with her, one of our team will be in touch to discuss the options.</p>
        <p>Both Beth and Sophie are at the same level
          as Ruby and will be happy to look after you. We also have Becca and Eve who are both close to graduating.</p>
