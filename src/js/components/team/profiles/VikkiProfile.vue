          <h1>HEY THERE, I'M<br><span>VIKKI.</span></h1>
        </div>
        <p class="is-size-5">I'm a spirited hairstylist and educator with a deep love for all things hair and a heart full of passion. My life revolves around two incredible forces: family and the vibrant world of hairstyling. And with a boy and a girl who keep me endlessly entertained and on my toes, my world is a symphony of laughter, growth, and love.</p>

        <p>When I'm not busy crafting stunning hairstyles, I'm immersing myself in the enchanting world of movies and TV shows, finding solace in the pages of a captivating book, or soaking up the energy of live music performances.</p>
        <p>These moments of quiet reflection and shared experiences bring balance and inspiration to my life, fuelling my creativity and zest for the art of hairstyling.</p>
        <p>My journey in the hairstyling realm spans over two decades, an exhilarating 22 years that have been marked by growth, learning, and transformation. It's a journey that I'm excited to continue as I take on the rewarding role of Lead Trainer and advanced stylist at Base Hairdressing.</p>

        <p class="is-size-5">Guiding and shaping the talents of the next generation of stylists is a responsibility I carry with pride and dedication. My personal style can be described as a harmonious blend of modern-vintage charm, with a touch of methodical precision. </p>
        <p>Beyond the salon, I channel my creativity into crafting intricate crochet garments, a testament to my eye for detail and knack for bringing ideas to life. And let's not forget my deep-rooted fascination with vintage fashion â€“ a love affair that has spanned two decades.</p>

        <p class="is-size-5">As a child, I found my passion for hairstyling in the most unexpected of places: my beloved Barbie dolls. Little did I know that those playful experiments would pave the way for a fulfilling career.</p>
        <p>My journey took me through various salons, including a memorable stint at Haircuttery, where I honed my skills and evolved into a supervisor.</p>
        <p>My path eventually led me to our sister salon Jakata, where I spent a fulfilling 11 years before being entrusted with the position of Lead Trainer at Base.</p>
