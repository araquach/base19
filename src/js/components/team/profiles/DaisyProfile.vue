        <p class="is-size-4">I've always had a <strong>burning dream</strong> of being a hairstylist. I'll admit, I let other people's
          opinions sway me, so I ended up at college pursuing something I wasn't truly interested in. But you know what
          they say, <strong>the heart wants what it wants</strong>. During lockdown, something inside me clicked, and I rediscovered my
          <strong>passion for hairdressing</strong>. So, I took the plunge, and here I am.</p>

        <p class="is-size-5">But here's something unique about me that not everyone knows, Iâ€™m a <strong>mirror twin</strong>. That's
          right, I have a twin sibling who's my mirror image, and it's always been an intriguing aspect of my life.
          Growing up, we shared an extraordinary bond, almost like two halves of the same whole. While we may look
          alike, our personalities couldn't be more different, yet complementary in a fascinating way.</p>
        <p class="is-size-5">I've always been a bit of an introvert, a tad shy, but that all changes around the right
          people, and I'm the happiest version of myself whilst working at <strong>Base Hairdressing Training Academy</strong>. When it
          comes to my career, I'm all about making people fall in love with their hair. I find immense satisfaction in
          seeing the transformations I bring to life.</p>

        <p class="is-size-5">Beyond my professional endeavours, I find solace in the company of my family and my
          adorable dog, Franklin. At heart, I'm a bookworm who can get lost in the world of literature, and I can't
          resist the allure of good music. Nothing beats leisurely walks with my mom, sisters, and Franklin. My family
          means the world to me, and their unwavering support fuels my passion for this craft.</p>
        <p class="is-size-4">So, if you're looking for someone who's <strong>creative, kind, and trustworthy</strong>, that's me, Daisy.
          My goal? To be the <strong>unique and skilled hairstylist</strong> who brings out the best in your hair and helps you rock your
          confidence.</p>
