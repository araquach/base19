        <p>Hi, I'm Sophie and I've been hairdressing for around 3 years now. I started when I had just left school back in 2016, up until 2 years later when I decided I wanted to try something different. I never knew what it was I really wanted to do with my life. After college, 2 jobs, nothing was the same. I knew that I needed something more. Hairdressing is the only thing that has made me feel satisfied that I am actually making a difference in peoples lives. I love the feeling of making someone smile as hair is such a big thing in everyone's lives. I saw Base's advert during my job search and I knew it was the place for me.. somewhere that was willing to assess where we are at already within our careers and taking the time to push us to be the best we can be. I just love how confident they are in us, as soon as I walked in for my interview I got a good vibe.</p>

        <p>My favourite thing to do in hairdressing is short cuts, I don't know what it is they just look so slick and smart! I love a good bob. I was so scared of them at first but with the right techniques and the right support I got the techniques down with only a few tweaks to the end result. The majority of my clients are pretty experimental with their hair I think crazy colours, blondes and bobs are my most popular look at the moment! So trendy! I would say this is probably my speciality.</p>
        <p>My favourite product is the UV Colour Freeze Liquid Shine, I think it's fab how it smooths the hair but protects all your hard work colouring at the same time.</p>

        <p>I enjoy training at Base purely because of the freedom. Nothing is too much. No matter how much experience you have, the other members of staff will always be happy to help and guide you along the way to ensure that your work is produced to the best of your ability. I love how creative everybody is and there is no limits. I already have a few clients who have come back to me with good feedback, I'd like to hope they will stick by me as I move up in my journey through hairdressing. I can see myself building up a steady client base and becoming more and more confident. I can see myself running a column and travelling places because of my career.</p>
        <p>Outside of hairdressing I enjoy hanging out with family and going out, but I love relaxing and watching films. Pamper nights are my favourite.</p>
