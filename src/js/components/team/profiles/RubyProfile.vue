        <p>Hi I am Ruby and I began hairdressing in November 2019 - so I still have much more to learn on my journey to becoming a stylist yet I have loved every moment along the way.</p>
        <p>As a child I always had a passion for hair and beauty, beginning with styling my two older sisters hair with plaiting and braiding, not to mention chopping off the hair of my Barbie dolls with the kitchen scissors! Becoming a hairdresser is doing what I love, and loving what I do. Not only that but I get to empower other women with the snip of my scissors. Being a hairdresser is about building a relationship with clients by listening and catering to their needs and wants.</p>
        <p>It’s not only creating artwork I am proud of, it's also using my own talent to achieve a look that gives somebody not only beauty on the outside but confidence within themselves which is one of the most rewarding things. As I continue on my journey I feel I am growing as an individual collecting knowledge and being able to express my creativity in endless ways. Moreover, I enjoy the constant learning whether it be about the science and complexity behind hair corrections, the hair structure, colour knowledge or cutting skills there’s always more to be educated on. Hairdressing is my passion and I could not be more grateful to have the opportunity to pursue my career dreams.</p>

        <p>Base academy is a fashion forward edgy salon that keeps up to date with all the recent trends which is why I believe I fit in perfectly with my stylish and creative ideas. Base provides the best training to the highest standards and endless opportunities to grow and progress as a hairdresser. Base itself and its two partner salons Paul Kemp and Jakata are all recognised and respected for the amazing work produced by all stylists who are inspirational to me and my work and the best colleagues to learn from.</p>
        <p>Olaplex is my holy grail! I love all Olaplex products however No.3 has to be my absolute favourite and has completely transformed my own hair. Olaplex Hair Perfector is moisturising, smoothing and reconstructing for the hair as well as being sulphate & paraben free. Just to top it off Olaplex is perfect for colour treated hair which is an absolute bonus for me being someone who I always changing up my colour.</p>
        <p>Schwarzkopf BC Silver shampoo is perfect for blondes who want to get rid of any brassy yellow tones. Not only does this shampoo help tone between colour sessions it also has ph 4.5 balancer technology which seals the surface of coloured hair, freezing the colour pigments deep inside the hair.</p>
        <p>Kevin Murphy Young again hair oil is definitely one of my must have products for dry and brittle hair. This is a weightless leave in treatment oil which regenerates hair, enhances shine and leaves your hair feeling soft, smooth and conditioned.</p>

        <p>My two biggest influences in the hair industry have to be James Earnshaw and Shannon JJ Williams as their work is incredible. I also love the style and trend of boho.blonde.perth on Instagram their salon in Australia Boutique blonde salon is exactly what I aspire to doing years to come with the dream of opening up my own salon in Australia too.</p>
        <p>I enjoy working at Base as the team get along so well like a big family. The opportunities are endless having begun at Base, with no past college or salon experience I am overwhelmed by the amount of progress I have made in such a short amount of time and this would not have been possible without all the training available. Not only do we have a centralised training academy we also have the opportunity to help out in the other larger salons and see what our future will consist of when we are fully qualified with a solid client base.</p>
        <p>Outside of hairdressing I love watching Crime Documentaries and conspiracy theories as well as spending time with my sisters or walking the dog.</p>
