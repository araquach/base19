        <p class="is-size-5">Hi, I'm Lauren. I've been hairdressing for almost 3 years now. I always considered doing hairdressing as a career since being a child as I have always found interest in experimenting with styling friends and family members hair!
          I knew hairdressing would be the right thing for me to Dao as a career as I enjoyed it so much.</p>
        <p>For my first year of training I worked at <strong>Paul Kemp Hairdressing</strong> (Base wasn't open at this point) which was great for my learning as it was more of a hands on experience giving me the opportunity to  see for myself whilst learning what hairdressing was all about.</p>
          <p>I then moved over to work at <strong>Base hairdressing</strong> which was the PK training academy for all new learners and graduates,
          this was so much better and easier for my learning as it had staff there that were there to mainly help and train you to the best you can be and
            <em>there was always help when needed which helps fast track your skills</em>.</p>
        <p>Learning to do hair is so good as you cover so many different ways and styles of colouring cutting and styling hair, but what I enjoy doing the most is cutting hair as it can go from simple to creative - its so exciting and interesting to learn  all the different ways of cutting and creating different hairstyles and colours.</p>

        <p class="is-sie-5">The most recent thing I've been working on is improving my <strong>men's hairdressing skills</strong> which is something I've always wanted to do! It's a whole different set of skills including working with clippers and understanding has shapes and hair growth patterns.</p>
        <p>Working with hair also means you work with a wide range of products, so here's a few of my favourite products I personally like to use and why!</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Schwarzkopf BLOW & GO</strong> - this is one of my favourite products. It not only speeds up your blowdrying time, it also leaves a smooth and sleek, shiny finish which is perfect for a sleek, straight blow dry. It's also creates a  perfect canvas for when you move on to styling your clients hair.</li>
          <li><strong>OSIS SPARKLER</strong> - this is a shine spray that is perfect for your finished result as it makes your hair so shiny and glossy and it also smells lovely!</li>
          <li><strong>BC SEALED ENDS</strong> -  I  love this product as you can use it on both wet and dry hair. Its perfect for when you style your hair and you feel like you have a few split ends that need to be covered up! It creates a film that does just that, to help create a fresher look!</li>
          <li><strong>BC REPAIR RESCUE NUTRI-SHEILD SERUM</strong> -  this is my go-to product and is literally my favourite one! It's so light on the hair so won‚Äôt weigh it down. Not only is it designed to help your damaged hair, whether it be from heat colour or bleach or just environmental damage, you can also use it as a serum to smooth down any fly aways. It also has heat protection already in the product which is a MUST for anyone! </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="is-size-5">The main thing I love about working at <strong>Base</strong> is not only are you getting constant training and learning more and more skills each day, you also get to experience
          <strong>independence and confidence</strong> by doing your own clients and then moving on to running your own column.
          <em>You can develop at your own pace in a relaxed environment knowing help is available whenever you need
            it</em> until you're ready to take your column to the next stage.</p>
        <p>Whilst learning at Base you also get the privilege to work at either of our sister salons <strong>Paul Kemp
          Hairdressing or Jakata</strong> helping out with the day to day running of the salon - greeting clients, washing hair, making drinks and being able help and learn from other staff members which is great for your confidence and learning.</p>
        <p>When I'm not in work I spend my time out with my friends going to clubs & parties or even just food and a catch up. I also spend my time with my little boy and boyfriend making memories with them! I also love to go shopping and watching reality tv shows eating junk food and snacks in my pjs‚úåüèª</p>
        <p>In the next few years in my career I would love to work back stage for a <strong>catwalk shows or photoshoots</strong> as its something I've always been interested in. I also eventually want to be known for my work and working on celebrities hair as I think that's something that would interest me.</p>
