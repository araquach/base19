We're excited to announce that our senior stylist Jo is returning from maternity leave! She's back in the salon every Saturday from this weekend!

From mid September her hours will increase to Thursday 11am - 8pm and Saturday 9am to 5.30pm

If you're a regular of Jo's ensure to book early to ensure she has availability!
