It's coming up to a year since we launched Base and what an amazing year it's been! We opened the salon with a plan to create a great new space to train and develop our apprentices and upcoming stylists. In the short time since we've opened we've recruited 3 new apprentices and we've progressed 2 of our trainers to graduate stylist level and we're looking at taking on a new set of candidates very soon.

Getting the salon ready to open was a long process with the Bridge Street premises (which was previously the home of our other salon - Jakata) taking on a full renovation. After a full year of ripping plaster off walls to expose the brickwork and knocking down walls - all project managed by Jimmy - the new Base premises was exactly how we wanted it!

Check out the before and after shots below.
