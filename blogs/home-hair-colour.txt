Now that we're temporarily closed for a minimum of 3 weeks, (with the possibility of being closed for 2-3 months!), we understand the panic of how you're all going to manage to keep your hair looking its best!

The unprecedented scale of events that are unfolding should push haircare down the priority list but we've still got to look at ourselves in the mirror everyday and seeing those roots get more visible everyday is a potentially daunting prospect.

If you watched The One Show on Monday you would've seen supposed industry professional Michael Douglas suggesting home hair colouring as a great option for everyone whilst the salons are shut! <link here>
I was truly horrified by the advice as we witness the damage done by box dyes practically on a daily basis.
Further delving 
 
*Our advice to you is please be patient and don't be tempted to colour or cut your hair yourselves. Here's why...*

1. Our team have years of technical training in hair colouring, with an in depth understanding of the science of hair and the complicated chemical processes involved in hair colouring.
2. Box colours are extremely generic - a one colour suits all approach. In contrast we have a palette of over 300 hundred colours divided into 6 different categories suited to specific hair needs. Every colour we do is a bespoke mix based on a detailed assessment every visit. This ensures your hair is kept in optimal condition and the colour result is perfect every time
