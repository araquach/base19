We are known for our hair transformations and each and every stylist LOVES this part to our job.

As the seasons change a new colour trend will evolve and our team are equipped with plenty of ideas to shake up your style. Currently we are seeing the ruturn of the rich reds and coppers. As well as our much loved silver blondes and 'Shadow roots'
Fringes and 'Bangs' are also making a come back this spring/summer with a natural dressed out curl/wave
We also have a team of extension specialists on hand whether its to add a small amount to thicken up or a full head to add extra inches

If you are thinking of changing your hair up whether it be big or small here are some tips to help the team out

- Call the salon and book in a free consultation ahead of your appointment. This will allow our stylists more time to talk through exactly what you want or give you some ideas. That way we can make sure your appointment is booked for the right amount of time and you in turn are aware of any extra costs there might be or after care knowledge ahed of time. You may only require a phone consultation or we may need you to come in to strand test. Its very tricky to discuss any changes over email or our facebook page and we will always advice to call or pop in. If its a larger service we may require a small deposit to secure your booking

- Be honest about whats previously on your hair and what you use at home. This is so important to our stylists. Most supermarket shampoos leave silicone residue on the hair that will block a colour from developing fully into the hair and also make what dose develope fade off even quicker. Old box dies even if it was 2-3 years ago will still be in the hair this also affects hair texture and how our colours develope and last. Never feel like you will be judged for whats been previously done or used. We have to ask to fully understand your hair history and ensure what we are doing is right for your hair. In turn our aftercare advice is KEY to maintain.

- Photos are great! We have some clients apologise for bringing photos but actually it helps us so much to understand exactly what your looking for. No its never going to be EXACTLY the photo as every head of hair is unique but it dose allow us to explaine what is or is not possible and we can customize your idea.

- Have a open mind. If its a change you are wanting then you are in the right place. We are fully traind to asses not only hair but skin tone, eye colour, face shape plus many other factors. This may change what you want after discussing your day to day routene. Our advice is always key to to maintaing the colour and cut. If it is a colour change It may also take afew sessions to get to your desired shade and our team can give you a idea on this before you commit.
