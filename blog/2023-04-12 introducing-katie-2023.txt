Katie's hardworking and determined nature shone through in her interview and we knew instantly she was the right fit for Base. The way she spoke about her dedication and passion for customer service lined up with our values when it comes to the salon experience and customer service we provide. 

It is important to us that clients have an upbeat experience and leave the salon ecstatic.  Katie brings a great energy and really works at communicating and educating clients so that they can maintain their hair at home between visits.

"I like to recommend products and tools and show clients how to use them to help them achieve or keep a style at home"

Not only that but Katie is renowned in the salon for her creativity and technical skills. One of her favourite things to do is hair ups and she has even been awarded for her avant-garde approach.
