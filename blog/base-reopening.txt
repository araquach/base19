It's been a long time coming but we're happy to say we're finally back open!

We've had some full-on days of non-stop colouring and cutting with the whole team on form, doing what they love best! 

We're loving catching up with all of our clients after so long and getting stuck into some major re-styles! Never seen so much hair dropping to the floor ðŸ˜‚.

The salon remains a COVID safe space and we're doing our best to keep it that way.

*Our phone lines are remaining off for a week or two until we catch up - we're pretty much booked up until May now with only the odd gap for cut and blows and mens cuts.*

If you need to get in touch please leave a message on our voicemail or message us through Facebook messenger and we'll get back as soon as we possibly can.

If you haven't got an appointment and are looking to book in, please register here:

Again, please be patient for a response as the whole team are flat out for the next few weeks.

Don't forget to use our skin test questionnaire to see if you need an update before your colour [Allergy Alert Test Info >](/blog/allergy-alert-test)

**Can't wait to see you all soon!**
