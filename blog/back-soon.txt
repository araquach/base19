With the end of lockdown in sight we're getting ready for our big reopening!

The Base team are gearing themselves up for another crazy few months of non-stop hairdressing - sorting out long overdue root re-growths and some seriously overgrown manes!

We have a reopening date of 13th April - only a few weeks off now. It's not set in stone but we're fairly confident we'll be up and running on this date - we'll keep you updated.

We're dealing with bookings in the fairest way possible, with all appointments that were missed due to lockdown contacted first followed by everyone who has registered. (If you haven't already registered do it here: [www.basehairdressing.com/bookings](/bookings))

The process will take some time with stylists looking after their own bookings, but don't worry - if you had a booking or are on our list you can be assured you'll be getting a call before we reopen.

Please be aware that you'll receive your call from your stylists mobile number as they are not in work. Make sure you don't miss it, and check your voicemail.

The guidelines remain the same as before we closed - at least initially. We'll keep you posted of any changes. You can see them here: [Covid Guidelines](/corona)

Please be aware our skin test procedure has been updated and the duration between tests has been reduced to 6 months from 12 months. Find out if you need a skin test here:

**We can't wait to see you and make your hair look amazing again!**

**Take care and see you soon!**
