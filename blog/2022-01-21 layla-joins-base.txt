We're excited to announce that Layla has joined us here at Base Hairdressing - to manage the team and head up the training for the apprentices.

We launched the Base Academy two years ago and we've trained and developed our apprentices to the highest standard. We felt it was time to implement a full time manager on site who could inspire and motivate the team on a daily basis. Layla fit the bill perfectly with her fresh, creative approach to hairdressing.

Layla has been a member of the Jakata team (our sister company) for many years - she's a fantastic hairdresser with tons of experience. She loves doing high fashion work - especially crazy colours and pastel blondes!

For any clients who are already regulars of Layla's, don't worry - nothing changes other than all your appointment's will no longer be at Jakata - you'll instead be here at our Base Hairdressing site.

**Good luck to Layla in her new role!**
