At Base, we are passionate about developing new stylists with a variety of skillsets and backgrounds to achieve their full potential. Working through our graduate program, stylists have the opportunity to progress from a New Starter all the way to an Advanced Senior Stylist. Once the stylists reach Graduate level at Base, they then have the opportunity to move on to either Jakata Salon or Paul Kemp Hairdressing. This will allow them to take on more clients at higher rates and work their way up through the ranks.  

We are excited to announce we have recently taken on two new additions to the Base team, Jamie and Sarah! Both are new to the hairdressing industry, however they share a passion for all things hair, beauty and fashion. 

# Sarah Cuddy

Sarah started hairdressing in July 2021, with no previous experience. She's always been a creative person, therefore hairdressing seemed like a great way to utilise her creative flare.

*"Base instantly seemed like the right place for me. After tonnes of experience of being a client myself (at Jakata), I loved having my hair done there. I always felt relaxed and the experience would constantly brighten up my day. And so I knew this was an environment Iâ€™d like to work in."*

# Jamie Banning

Jamie's passion for hairdressing began 4-5 years ago when he would style hair as favours for people. He's now decided hairdressing is the career for him as it's something that he really enjoys.

*"I decided to work for base as it seemed like a really unique opportunity and I thought it was time for a change and to work on my career, I also wanted to advance my pre existing skills."*
