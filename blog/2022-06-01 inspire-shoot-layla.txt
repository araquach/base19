My experience at the Schwarzkopf Professional Inspire shoot with Tyler Johnson was incredible. The whole experience from start to finish was so inspiring and educational. I learnt so much from Tyler Johnston who is one of my hair idols. To get one to one mentoring and guidance from him was fabulous and has made my passion for hairdressing and session styling so much bigger. 

Since starting hairdressing as a junior stylist my goals and dreams have always been session styling and photoshoot work, and I feel extremely grateful to have been given such an incredible opportunity on set by Schwarzkopf Professional and to have my work featured in Creative Head. The atmosphere on shoot day with the rest of the Inspire team was such a high and I’ve made incredible friends with all the other talented stylists there. “

## The Method: 
In salon I’m so used to doing lots of texture, so I wanted to create something a bit sleeker. I also find the bowl cut so timeless and interesting, so I combined these ideas to create the finished look. 

I washed the hair with the new Bonacure Clean Balance Deep Cleaning range, to thoroughly cleanse the hair and to achieve a gorgeous shine. I then prepped the hair with Session Label THE MOUSSE which gave me great hold and has such an easy application as it has the spray nozzle. I also used THE MIRACLE for that smooth shine finish. I then wrap dried the hair, this helped to create volume in the hair and that sleek rounded finish that I was striving for. Next, I clipped the hair at the back to achieve the illusion of the timeless bowl cut and trimmed around the fringe to enhance that rounded shape with the layers. Then finished with THE FLEXIBLE hairspray so that i could manipulate the hair with my fingers to get the overall shape perfect for the shot.
