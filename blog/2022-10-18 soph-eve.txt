Since Base launched a few years back we've trained & developed half a dozen budding hairdressers to an exceptional standard, with 4 more currently on the path to being skilled stylists and a further 2 or 3 to be recruited soon! It's great to see young talent flourish under the guidance of an expert team. Focused, driven individuals can work their way through the ranks quickly under expert guidance!

We opened Base Hairdressing to create a platform for anyone who wants to become a hairdresser to train in the best environment with some seriously talented hairdressers, using a relaxed and enjoyable hands on approach. The ultimate goal to feed talented staff to Jakata & Paul Kemp Hairdressing

Two of the Base team are now ready to make the move over to new sites. Both **Sophie** and **Eve** will be relocating this month! Testament to their hard work, dedication and passion for hairdressing.

Sophie will be moving over to join the **Jakata Team** from the start of November. She'll continue to develop her skills alongside some inspirational stylists and work her way up to becoming a Senior Stylist over the coming years.

Eve joined the team this time 2 years ago and has gone from strength to strength. She showed early signs of being a great stylist and has honed and fine-tuned her skills to the point where she is ready to move to the next level. She's making a move over to join the Paul Kemp Hairdressing team

We'll miss having their 2 huge personalities here in Base, but we know they'll both be valuable assets in their new salons and they're both super excited to start the next step in their careers!

**Good luck to both of them!**
