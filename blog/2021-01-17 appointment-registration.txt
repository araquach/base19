We hope you're all doing ok and staying safe throughout this new lockdown! We're gutted to be closed again but using the time to explore some new ideas and look at making our training even better this year!

Beth, Sophie & Ruby are all flying through their training and producing outstanding work - it won't be long before they're all Graduate stylists! We're also excited to get our new candidates trained up - Eve and Becca - who joined us at the back end of last year and are already fully settled into the team. We'll also be looking at taking on more trainees too - so exciting times ahead!

We're still not sure when we'll be able to re-open, but if you want to get booked in with minimum fuss then please register here: [ - Register for your appointment -](/bookings)
As soon as we've got a date our team will be in touch to get you booked in.

**Can't wait to see you all again soon**
