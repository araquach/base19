At Base Hairdressing, we’ve always believed that the best stylists are grown, not just trained. And this year, we’ve seen our next generation truly grow. 

After all, Base isn’t just our name, it’s our foundation. It’s where creativity begins, confidence builds, and careers grow.

The Next Generation: Kam, Lily and Jaz.

# From Apprentices to Full Time Stylists

We’re incredibly proud to see Jaz, Lily and Kam now fully qualified and thriving on the salon floor. Each of them started with us as fresh apprentices, new to the world of hairdressing, eager to learn and ready to get stuck in.

Through hands on training, mentoring and real salon experience, they’ve developed into confident stylists with their own growing client columns and distinctive styles. Watching that journey unfold is exactly what Base is all about, building from the ground up, nurturing talent and seeing people flourish.

# Why Apprenticeships Matter

In the UK, apprenticeships are vital to the future of hairdressing. They create real career pathways, allowing young people to learn through doing, rather than sitting in a classroom.

At Base, we believe learning on the job is where the magic happens. All coursework is completed in-house, guided by our experienced educators. And with the support of our sister salons, Paul Kemp Hairdressing and Jakata, our apprentices gain experience in busy, real-world salon environments from day one.

They assist stylists, learn how to handle clients and get to feel the pace, energy and creativity that comes with professional salon life. That kind of training doesn’t just build skills, it builds confidence, professionalism and genuine passion for the craft.

# Investing in the Future

Taking on apprentices is more than a training programme, it’s an investment in people. By giving them a strong foundation, we’re shaping the future of our industry and ensuring that the next generation of stylists carries forward the same passion, creativity and standards we believe in.

That’s exactly what we see in Jaz, Lily and Kam. Each of them brings something unique to the team, their own spark, style and energy, yet they all share that drive to keep learning and pushing themselves. They’re proof that when you build from a strong Base, incredible things grow.

Every stylist who trains through Base adds something fresh to the salon, new ideas, enthusiasm and a love for the craft that keeps everyone inspired.
