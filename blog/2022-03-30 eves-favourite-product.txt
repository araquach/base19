If you have unruly hair, all you need is these two products. The Perfect Duo Layering System from Schwarzkopf's BC Keratin Smooth Perfect range. Not only do they control rebellious hair, but add a gorgeous shine for up to 72 hours! The cream treatment not only provides discipline and shine to hair, but it also makes it much more manageable. 

## What's in it?
The main ingredient found in the smooth perfect range is keratin, which is widely found in cosmetic products. It is the foundation of human hair and skin and secures the healthy protective outer layer. As well as giving you a Brazilian blow-dry affect from the comfort of your own home, it also provides you with heat protection up to 210 ยบ C. 

## How does it work?
The layer 1 taming lotion works deep within the hair using hydrolysed keratin to perfect the hairs cells. The layer 2 anti-frizz shield, infused with babassu oil, creates a shield over the hair to protect the hair against humidity for up to 72 hours, giving you the most perfect smooth and silky hair. 

## How do I use it?
Start by applying 1 or 2 pulses of Layer 1 to damp hair and comb it through. Follow by working Layer 2 into your hair (do not rinse), and then just comb and dry your hair as usual. 
If you want maximum smoothness and shine, apply Layer 2 to dry hair. 

If you would like to try this product out, just ask your stylist at you next appointment. 

Or, pop into the salon to pick one up yourself.
