Base Hairdressing opened its doors back in 2019 and has managed to build up to a team of 7 new apprentices. Two of the stylists who played a key role in getting Base to where it is today is Graduate Stylists, Lauren Watson and Lucy Watson. 

Lauren began her hairdressing journey with us at Paul Kemp, shortly before Base had opened. She really enjoyed her time there, learning from a group of extremely talented hairstylists. However, as Base is a training academy, we felt it would be the best place for her to develop her skills. At Base, staff are always on hand to help and train you to be the best you can be. You are also surrounded by other like-minded individuals who are in the same boat as you. This is great when you are learning so you can bounce ideas and give advice to one another. 

It is now time for Lauren to return to PK as a Graduate Stylist. 
All the PK team are excited to have her back and she's thrilled to be back with her former team members. During her time at PK, Lauren hopes to build up her client base and carry on developing her skills as a stylist.

Graduate Stylist, Lucy Watson will soon be returning to Jakata Salon, where her love and passion for hairdressing first grew. After spending 2 years at Jakata and learning from our talented senior stylists, she moved to Base, where she could receive more intensive training. She has managed to work her way up to the next level from Advanced Junior Stylist to Graduate Stylist. We now feel she is ready to take on the next step in her career and grow her client base back at Jakata. 

Lucy is very excited to return to Jakata and all the team are looking forward to welcoming her back.
