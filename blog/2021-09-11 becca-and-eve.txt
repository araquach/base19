Becca and Eve both joined us at the end of 2020 last year. Both came to us as New Starters and have already progressed leaps and bounds. Considering 3 months of the year we were in lockdown, they have managed to settle in well and gain a lot more confidence in their abilities as stylists.

Both of them have been producing some amazing work and they're eager to take on more clients extend their skillsets. Check out some of their recent creations here...
