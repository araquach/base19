We have some very exciting news to announce... 
Sophie has passed her end point exam and is soon to move up to a Graduate Stylist position!

If you're wondering what this means for Sophie,  it means she has progressed to the next level of the graduate program we run in our salons, a career ladder that progresses each stylist up the ranks and runs as follows:

Level 1 - New Starter

Level 2 - Junior Stylist

Level 3 - Advanced Junior Stylist

Level 4 - Graduate Stylist 

Level 5 - New Stylist

Level 6 - Stylist

Level 7 - Advanced Stylist

Level 8 - Senior Stylist 

Level 9 - Advanced Senior Stylist 

Now she has passed her end point exam she will move to graduate stylist level, and once her skills are fully honed she will have the opportunity to move to either [Paul Kemp Hairdressing](https://www.paulkemphairdressing.com/) or [Jakata Salon](https://www.jakatasalon.co.uk/), where she can continue developing her skills, take on more clients and work her way up the ranks. 

She has been working extremely hard recently, preparing for her end-point exam. We asked Sophie to give us some feedback on how the exam went. 

## Sophie

*"I recently completed my level 2 end point assessment and I am extremely pleased to say I passed!*

*I was so nervous but also looking forward to going in and proving myself as this has been 2 full years leading up to this one day!* 

*I had to complete 1 colour and cut restyle and a curly blow dry into pin curls and a then into a hair up.* 

*I had to treat it just like it was a normal day in the salon and be myself. I am so happy I am now a qualified hairdresser and all my hard work over the last 2 years has paid off!"*
