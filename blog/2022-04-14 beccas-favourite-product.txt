BC Hyaluronic Moisture Kick BB Hydra Pearl is aimed towards hair that is dry, curly, wavy or normal to slightly porous.
So if you feel as though your hair has any of these qualities then this is a perfect product for you. 

To use this product all you need to do is apply at the roots to the ends after you’ve washed with shampoo and conditioner then rinsed. After, towel dry your hair and apply and proceed to dry your hair. It is perfect as it also helps to protect hair from  heat damage so there’s no need for an extra heat protector during your hair care routine. 

This is a lightweight product that is perfect for conditioning dry hair. It feels like water in your hands so you won’t feel it in your hair if you don’t like feeling as though your hair has product in. Not only that it also balances the hairs natural moisture content, restores and adds shine so your hair always feels freshly done and stops it from looking dull. It also improves the strength and elasticity in your hair keeping it bouncy. 

This product is not only for those with curly hair, it also can be applied to the straightest of hair to get that smooth, shiny and healthy blow dry you’ve always wanted with minimum effort. 

If you’re thinking this product is too good to believe, this is the science behind it:

The cell perfecter technology and hyaluronic acid intensively rehydrates and helps protect the hair. The bi-textured treatment weightlessly conditions the hair. hyaluronic acid derivate rebalances the hair moisture level while the eye- catching pearls contain glycerin for that additional moisture!

If you wish to purchase this product, just pop into our salon to pick one up.
