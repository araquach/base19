At Base, we want our stylists to have the ability to develop their skills, to be the best they can be. We feel it's so important to give or apprentices as much industry experience as possible, so this is why we organised a photoshoot to take place in the salon. It was nothing too serious, just a bit of fun for all the stylists to come together, get creative and try out some different hairstyles, which they might not normally get to do on clients. 

For hairdressers, working in a photography studio can be worlds apart from cutting clients hair in the salon. It allows you to think outside the box, and really get creative with hair. But, it also gets the stylists thinking about how the hair will photograph and how the shapes, colours and textures will work well together and with the model. 
 
Each stylist came up with 2 different looks to create on their model, revolving around a theme they picked for themselves. Some went for the edgy, grungy kind of vibe, others gravitated to more glam or boho themes. It was great to see how each stylist injected some of their own personal style into the looks.
