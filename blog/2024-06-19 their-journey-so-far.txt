**Becky** and **Daisy** have reached a significant milestone in their training and we sat down with them to learn more about their experiences at **Base Hairdressing**. Here’s what they had to say:

**Becky** - *"I discovered my true calling in hairdressing during lockdown. Specialising in vivid colours, blondes, and balayage, I love seeing transformations happen. The team at Base has been incredibly supportive, helping me perfect my craft and build lasting relationships with clients. I've made great progress in learning new techniques and boosting my confidence in handling various hair types and styles and I'm very excited to be opening my column on Saturdays."*

**Daisy** - *"Rediscovering my passion for hairdressing during lockdown brought me to Base. I find immense satisfaction in transforming clients' looks. The expert guidance and hands-on training at Base are invaluable in helping me become the hairstylist I aspire to be. I've learned so much about professional hair care, customer service, and staying updated with the latest industry trends."*

Starting this week, **Kam, Jaz, and Lily**, have all shown incredible growth and commitment to their training and are excited to offer more opportunities for clients to experience their talents. Here are their thoughts so far:

**Kam** - *"I thrive on the excitement of meeting new people and tackling challenging colour projects. Base provides amazing training and guidance, allowing me to explore my creativity and improve my skills every day. The progress I've made in my confidence and technique is incredible, from perfecting customer service skills to creating content to inspire clients."*

**Jaz** - *"Growing up in a family of hairstylists, I always knew I wanted to pursue this career. Watching my mom and aunts transform clients' looks inspired me deeply. Base stood out to me because of their incredible support system. One of my proudest moments was doing my first full head of highlights and seeing the client's happiness. The training here has significantly boosted my confidence, helping me believe in my ability to make clients feel their best. I stay updated with trends through social media, and the support from expert stylists at Base is unparalleled. I would tell anyone considering an apprenticeship here to go for it, it's the best decision I've ever made."*

**Lily** - *"I’m always up for a challenge and love collaborating with others. My goal is to help clients fall in love with their hair. At Base, the training and support I receive are exceptional, making it the perfect place to grow my skills. I've gained confidence in styling and cutting, as well as invaluable experience in customer interactions and using top quality hair products."*
