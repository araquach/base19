Can you believe it has been 13 whole weeks since we closed our doors?! We hope you are all doing well and are as excited to get your hair done as we are to do it!

Here's our latest update...

As it stands we have a potential reopening date of the **4th July**. This could change as it isn’t set in stone. We are not currently taking any bookings until we have our confirmed dates and our staff rota’s in place. We are unsure yet what our guidelines will be on working within the salon so we may have to re-jig things. We should get some clarity by the end of this week.

We have posted a page where you can register to be contacted for an appointment for when we do open the diary so we can get everyone booked in. We can see who has missed appointments and you will be contacted accordingly, but by all means please add your name to the list to confirm you want to get in as we understand some people may wish to wait still and see what the situation is like closer to the time. 

**Unfortunately our first year apprentices (Ruby, Sophie & Beth) will not be taking bookings until further notice** (probably 3-4 weeks after we open). If you want to get an appointment with one of them fill in the form and we'll get you in at the first opportunity. Lucy and Lauren will be taking bookings as normal.

Please bare with us and know we will do our best to get everyone in in the shortest time possible, but we are expecting high demand upon reopening. With potential restricted hours per stylist we will do our upmost to accommodate you.

*Thanks so much to all of our clients for being so patient and understanding that this situation is out of all of our hands. We cannot wait to get back to doing what we love best!*

**We hope to see you all very soon, we miss you! xx**
