On Sunday the 6th March myself and a few members of the team hopped on a train and made our way to the ghd Underground workshop. As we walked into the warehouse (which actually was underground), I was blinded by rows and rows of lit up mirrors. By the side of them lined up were GHD products and tools all for us to use! I was in heaven.

We got settled at our station and gathered around the stage. Extremely talented stylists Zoe Irwin, Christopher Laird and Michelle Thompson who work closely with ghd had prepared different looks to inspire us for when it was our turn. There was a total of 6 looks altogether - all completely different and individual. There was everything from Hollywood Waves to a sleek up-do, finished with tight curls sitting on top. It was so interesting to watch the stylists work and to learn from them.

Then it was time for us to get stuck in. I knew I wanted to master curling with tongs so I asked the reps that were on hand to show me different ways of curling with the tongs and once I was confident with that, I then moved on to actually creating my look. For my look I used the brand new ghd Thin Wand. The guys were all so friendly and happy to show us new techniques. I learnt 4 different ways of curling just with the mini wand!

We were given ‘Good Hair Day’ clips to finish off our looks and then we moved down to the social media area where we were ready to capture images of our models. There was a lady there who showed us different ways of holding lighting to enhance our images, she even changed the settings on our phones so we can get the most out of our camera! As taking pictures and sharing our images is so important nowadays to get your name out there-this is was so helpful.

I really feel like I learnt so much and I feel so confident in trying new things and giving my clients the best experience. I now know so many different ways of styling and I feel as though I could do anything my clients ask for! It’s so important to just say yes to these opportunities and giving them a go. I love being in the environment with other hairstylists, it’s such a buzz! I fell in love with my job all over again. Roll on the next one!
