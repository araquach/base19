Here at Base, we aim to deliver the highest standard of  training possible, to develop the next generation of hairstylists. Our intentions are to allow the Stylists the opportunity to work on their  skills over time and progress through the ranks  to become an Advanced Senior Stylist. 

Beth has been with us for just under 2 years and has around 3 years experience within the hair industry. She has recently moved up the ranks within our salon, from a Junior Stylist to an Advanced Junior Stylist. She is also the second Base team member to pass with a Distinction!

We've asked Beth to give us a little feedback on how her end point assessment went...

"For my end point assessment I had two clients in which I had to carry out different services on. 
For one I did foils and a cut restyle and for the other, a curly blow dry, pin curl and hair up.

I feel like it went really well on the day I kept myself as calm as I could and acted as if it was a normal day in the salon.

I was nervous yes but also excited, I feel so happy now knowing that I've passed and not only a pass but with a distinction!"

**A huge well done to Beth on her progression and we look forward to seeing how she develops her skills in the future!**
