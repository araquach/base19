We're excited to announce that Base is welcoming a new trainer  to the team - Vikki Rowland ðŸ™Œ

Vikki has been working over at **Jakata** for many years and has been a core member of the team. Her love of the industry and unique style has made her a prominent stylist in the salon.

With the increased training needs at Base as we recruit more apprentices, we decided it would be good to take on another trainer. Vikki fit the bill perfectly! She's always shown a key interest in training and her attention to detail is perfect for setting our new recruits on a pathway to becoming talented hairdressers.

Working alongside Layla and Jimmy we now have a training team    like no other! Since Base launched we're continually refining our training programme and the quality of work the new recruits produce is beyond anything we've seen before.

**If you're thinking of becoming a hairdresser and want the best possible training in an amazing environment then apply here now:**
