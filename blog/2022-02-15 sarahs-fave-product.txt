If you are someone who is always on the look-out for a dry shampoo that refreshes your hair, without leaving any residue, then you have come to the right place!

Sarah is a new starter here at Base and has given us the low down on what her favourite product is at the moment - Osis+ Fresh Texture Dry Shampoo foam from Schwarzkopf. 

Many dry shampoos on the market can be pretty drying for the hair and scalp, whereas, Osis+ Fresh Texture contains moisturising benefits, it's free from sulphates and surfactants, leaves no visible residue and is great for adding instant volume and fullness to the hair. It completely refreshes and cleanses the hair and doesn’t leave your hair feeling wet and is perfect for when you don’t have time to wash your hair or you are trying to use less heat on the hair. It doesn’t feel like normal dry shampoo, there is less powder residue, making it feel fresher and cleaner.

## How to use: 
- Apply the product to dry hair and massage at the root where needed. Common areas include the crown of the head, hairline round the face and the parting. 

Not only is it good for between hair washes, but it’s a great prep product for any textured hair looks, creating grip and reactivating volume in the hair. It contains 7 herbs that help to treat greasy scalps and combines flexible polymers with micro-raw particles to help obtain texture in the hair.
